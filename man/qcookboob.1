.SH CONDITION
The -c and --condition is a flexible way to sort and get only interesting results. It supports conditions on numerical values, dates, and strings. Dates are given in YYYY-MM-DD format.
The syntax of one expression is "\fBfield operator value\fR". The field to test is always the left member of the expression.
.LP
The field is a member of the objects returned by the command. For example, a bank account has "balance", "coming" or "label" fields.
.SS The following operators are supported:
.TP
=
Test if object.field is equal to the value.
.TP
!=
Test if object.field is not equal to the value.
.TP
>
Test if object.field is greater than the value. If object.field is date, return true if value is before that object.field.
.TP
<
Test if object.field is less than the value. If object.field is date, return true if value is after that object.field.
.TP
|
This operator is available only for string fields. It works like the Unix standard \fBgrep\fR command, and returns True if the pattern specified in the value is in object.field.
.SS Expression combination
You can make a expression combinations with the keywords \fB" AND "\fR and \fB" OR "\fR.

.SS Examples:
.nf
.B boobank ls \-\-condition 'label=Livret A'
.fi

.PP
.nf
.B boobank ls \-\-condition 'balance>10000'
